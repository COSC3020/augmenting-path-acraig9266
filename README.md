ChatGPT was used to debug the portion of code which was pushing path onto the stack if a neighbor node hadnt been visited. I seemed to have the right idea but JavaScript didn't like the exact method I was using.

When we talked about the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to find the maximum flow
through a graph, I mentioned the "find an augmenting path" function. You're
going to implement this function. Start with the template I provided in
`code.js`. Use an adjacency list data structure to represent the graph and node
names, not indices, to indicate start and end node. The function returns a list
of node names, starting with the start node and finishing with the end node. If
start and end node are the same, it should return a list containing only this
node. If there is no path, you must return an empty list.

Test your new function; I've provided some basic testing code in `code.test.js`.

To illustrate, here's an example graph:
![example graph](graph.png)

Here's the call for this graph:

```javascript
var graph = {'foo': {'boo': 7},
             'boo': {'foo': 3, 'bar': 2},
             'bar': {'boo': 4}};
augmentingPath(graph, 'foo', 'bar');
```

The call would return `['foo', 'boo', 'bar']`.

Feel free to use other data structures, but you'll have to change the test code
accordingly.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the worst-case big $\Theta$ complexity of your implementation? Add your
answer, including your reasoning, to this markdown file.

Each vertex can only be visited once as it checks. At each vertex, every edge is checked as well. So, in worst case, every vertex and every edge is being checked/visited before finding an augmented path. This would make the complexity T(n) ∈ Θ(V + E).
